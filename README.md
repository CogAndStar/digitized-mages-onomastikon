# digitized-mages-onomastikon
A couple name generators for CogAndStar's Unionverse setting, written in Python.

At present, they both just run in command line.

The generators are:

  wizard-name-generator.py, a generator for mainstream Union wizards.
  
  pukwudgie-namer.py, a generator for pukwudgies.
